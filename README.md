## **Project Statement:**

While searching for the dream house, the buyer looks at various factors, not just at the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.
Using the dataset, find the factors that influence price negotiations while buying a house.
There are 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.


Perform the following steps:

**1. Understand the dataset:**

    a. Identify the shape of the dataset
    
    b. Identify variables with null values
    
    c. Identify variables with unique values
    
**2.	Generate a separate dataset for numerical and categorical variables**

**3.	EDA of numerical variables:**

    a.	Missing value treatment
    
    b.	Identify the skewness and distribution
    
    c.	Identify significant variables using a correlation matrix
    
    d.	Pair plot for distribution and density
    
**4.	EDA of categorical variables**

    a.	Missing value treatment
    
    b.	Count plot and box plot for bivariate analysis
   
    c.	Identify significant variables using p-values and Chi-Square values
    
**5.	Combine all the significant categorical and numerical variables**

**6.	Plot box plot for the new dataset to find the variables with outliers**
